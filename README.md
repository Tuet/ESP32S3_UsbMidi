# pioarduino example how to get USB Midi running on an ESP32-S3 board

As it was hard (because it seems not all ESP32-S3 board definitions will give usefull results) to get USB MIDI running on an ESP32-S3 with pioarduino (a variant of Platformio) I have put here my working example. Look at platformio.ini for further information.
